                I won’t talk about the “Academy Incident,” but I was expelled for it. It wasn’t my fault, I swear. I have failed in my Father’s eyes, and I  am determined to win him over. My power comes naturally from my blood, I hate studying and hard work. I feel like I need to do everything myself, I have never really had any friends before. When my new-found friends yelled at me, I was filled with a new emotion: shame. I don’t want to disappoint them again, however, Father says that relying on others is a weakness. I need to use them and discard them… I’m not quite sure what to do.                </p></span></div>

                    I don’t know much about my Father, he wasn’t home very often growing up, and I was sent from boarding school to boarding school throughout my younger years. The family home was a mansion, however I really only spent my winters there during school holiday. I don’t know exactly how my father got his fortune, but I suspect it wasn’t good. My father didn’t take any notice of me until after my latent power began to manifest, he then sent me to Kharfrost Academy so that I might nurture the flame inside. I try my best to please him, but usually fall short. I don’t know what his goals are, but I have my suspicions.

                    Father was present when we escaped the dungeon, I don't recall telling him that I would be there... He wants me to go north so that I can prove myself once again. I'm not exactly sure why.
                    <br><br>I met a few people while in those dark tunnels, they seem to be pretty capable. Perhaps they can be useful to me. I will try to stick with them for now. <br>I'm sure that I made a good impression.

        <b><u>  My Journal </u></b> <br><br>
       <u>Father: Aurelion Ghaalix.  </u><br><i>  
Gold-scaled dragonborn, male. Mysterious, strict, controlling, and evil.</i><br>

I don’t know much about him, he wasn’t home very often growing up, and I was sent from boarding school to boarding school throughout my younger years. The family home was a mansion, however I really only spent my winters there during school holiday. I don’t know exactly how my father got his fortune, but I suspect it wasn’t good. My father didn’t take any notice of me until after my latent power began to manifest, he then sent me to Kharfrost Academy so that I might nurture the flame inside. I try my best to please him, but usually fall short. I don’t know what his goals are, but I have my suspicions.<br><br><br>

<u> Mother: Unknown.  </u><br>
None of my siblings recall ever having a mother, and we each have different colored scales…<br><br>

<u>Eldest brother: Marcus Ghaalix. </u><br><i> 
Red-scaled dragonborn, male. A large and burly barbarian. Ruthless.<br></i>

He was my father’s favorite child, until my blood magic manifested. However, I have not lived up to my father’s standards, and Marcus has become the favorite once again. He hates my guts. <br><br>


<u> Older sister: Lilith Ghaalix. </u><br><i> 
Black-scaled dragonborn, female. Evil cleric of Tiamat.<br></i>

Arguably she is a lot better caster than me, however she needs to work twice as hard to gain Father’s respect because she is a female. Evil to the core. I’m pretty sure that she has sacrificed people, and I don’t trust her very much. <br><br>

<u>Younger brother: Gailon Ghaalix. </u><br><i> 
Green-scaled dragonborn, male. Sneaky rogue. Fond of poison/acid.<br></i>

I honestly haven’t seen much of Gailon and have no idea of his current whereabouts. He may have fallen in with a bad crowd.<br><br>

<u>Younger sister: Avianna Ghaalix. </u><br><i> 
Silver-scaled dragonborn, female child. Meek and shy, good natured. No particular skills.<br></i>

I am quite fond of my sister Avianna. My father would have completely abandoned her as useless, however, he currently uses her to keep me motivated. He often punishes her when I disappoint him.<br><br>

 <u>Father’s right hand man: Voltaire. </u><br><i> 
Grey haired man that never seems to age.<br></i>


    I don’t know anything about him, except that he does my father’s dirty work. Usually people will need to speak to this man instead of meeting my father. In the twenty years that I’ve seen him, I’ve never noticed him age or eat. Very mysterious….
